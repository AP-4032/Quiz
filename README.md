# Advanced Programming Quizzes - Solutions

## Overview

This repository contains the solution codes for the **Advanced Programming** course quizzes. The solutions are written in **C#** and are made available after each quiz for students to review and learn from.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a specific quiz. Inside each folder, you will find:

-   **Solution Files (`.cs`)**: These files contain the correct implementation for each problem in the quiz.
-   **Documentation (`Q*`)**: Additional explanations or notes related to the quiz.

### Folder & File Structure:

```
/ (Root)
â”‚â”€â”€ 1/  (Quiz 1)
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 1.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 2.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 3.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 4.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 5.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ Q1 (Documentation)
â”‚â”€â”€ 2/  (Quiz 2)
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 1.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 2.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 3.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 4.cs
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ 5.cs

```

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to the Quiz Folder**: Locate the folder corresponding to the quiz number (e.g., `1/` for Quiz 1).
2. **Open the Solution Files**: Each problem solution is numbered accordingly (`1.cs`, `2.cs`, etc.).
3. **Review Documentation**: The `Q*` file provides additional details about the quiz.
4. **Learn from the Solutions**: Compare your own answers with the correct ones to understand the correct approach.

## Notes

-   These solutions are provided for **learning purposes only**. Students are encouraged to attempt the quizzes before reviewing the solutions.
-   If you have any questions, feel free to discuss them in the course forums or with the Teaching Assistants.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
